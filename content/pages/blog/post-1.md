Welcome to the launch of SF Shipping. We are on a mission to make shipping accessible to everyone. By offering a complete shipping service, we make shipping as easy as opening your door. We are currently operating an open beta and may have some bugs software-wise. With SF Shipping, we enable a door to door shipping experience.

Here's how SF Shipping works.

1.  Setup your appointment and let us know what you're shipping.


2.  Answer your door at your appointed time. Your shipping expert will package your item and/or apply your shipping label.

3\. Track your package

We are currently seeking feedback on our service and appreciate all feedback regarding your service experience.
